# XAI Analysis Summary Report

## Feature Importance Analysis

The most important feature for predicting stock prices is: **Close**
The least important feature is: **Volume**

## Temporal Importance Analysis

The most important time periods for prediction are: **t-5, t-3, t-4, t-2, t-1**
This suggests that recent data is more important for stock price prediction.

## Local Interpretability Analysis

For a specific prediction:

- Predicted value: 0.0593
- True value: 0.0513
- Prediction error: 0.0079

## Model Performance Metrics

- LSTM model:
  - MAE: 0.0057
  - RMSE: 0.0069
- Transformer model:
  - MAE: 0.0089
  - RMSE: 0.0097

## Financial Insights

Based on the XAI analysis, we can conclude that:

1. **Close** has the highest influence on stock price predictions
2. The correlation between **Close** and stock price is 0.8502
3. Time periods t-5, t-3, t-4, t-2, t-1 appear to have more influence on predictions than other periods

## Trading Recommendations

Based on the model's predictions and explanations:

1. Pay close attention to changes in **Close** as a leading indicator
2. Focus on recent market movements when making trading decisions
3. Be aware that the model has an average prediction error of 0.0057
4. The LSTM model appears to be more accurate for this particular stock

## Limitations

1. The models were trained on data up to February 2024 and may not capture recent market changes
2. Feature importance can change over time as market conditions evolve
3. Predictions should be used as one factor among many in making investment decisions
